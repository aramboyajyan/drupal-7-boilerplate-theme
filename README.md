# Ultimate [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org) starter theme

Robust HTML5 starter theme suitable for custom design and projects of any complexity.

The theme is completely built by using Drupal best practices and standards in coding.

### Features

- HTML5
- Most used preprocessing functions already setup (preprocess_page, preprocess_node, preprocess_html, preprocess_comment, preprocess_comment_wrapper, preprocess_search_result)
- Theme settings page
- Coming with custom build of [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) with 'supports-' prefix to all classes for easier and more semantic browser detection features.
- Coming with [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com) for emulating CSS3 pseudo-classes and attribute selectors in IE8
- Optional reset styles with [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
- Clean organization and flexible architecture for robust websites. The <code>template.php</code> file is used only to include all other files in order to avoid having one file with 1k+ lines of functions and overrides.
- Custom links preprocessing and wrapping in HTML5 nav tags
- Renaming and excluding tabs (local task menu items) mechanism
- Chrome frame for older browsers and no-JS notification
- [Skinr](http://drupal.org/project/skinr) support
- [Panels](http://drupal.org/project/panels) support
- Extended body classes to include vocabulary IDs, user roles and all arugments of current path
- Support for adding custom tracking scripts (Google Analytics, Piwik, Woopra, Gauge etc.)

### Note

There is another [Ultima theme](https://drupal.org/sandbox/topsitemakers/1825322) repository on Drupal.org; the reason this is on GitHub is that it is much more opinionated and contains third-party libraries.  
Check out the code of both themes to see which one works better for you.
